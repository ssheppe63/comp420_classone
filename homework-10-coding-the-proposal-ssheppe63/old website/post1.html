				Although this is my first official "blog post" this is not nearly the first time I've written my thoughts and adventures down. Usually my thoughts are on scraps of paper hidden and eventually thrown out, this blog is on the internet <em>for good</em>. Or at least saved on my computer for good. <br> <br>

				In five short days I'll board the plane to some country that for the life of my I can't remember and then board another plane to Budapest. I don't really feel a need to explain why I'm going to Budapest since this blog isn't really meant to be seen by anyone, but for future me looking back at this: AIT Budapest Computer Science Program. Remember?? <br><br>

				I guess I can talk about my feelings. For some reason, I'm not that nervous. It's not nearly my first time going somewhere new and starting over with friends. I'm excited to be with people who like computer science, but dead afraid that they all know waaaay more than me which they probably do. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ My parents are freaking out about everything. My dad gave me a portable clock that's battery operated "just in case" and he bought me a map of Budapest that I can fold up and put in my bag... Luckily it's laminated so I can draw on it too! I think I avoided getting a money bag to carry around my neck. As my dad told me "You don't know what they'll be saying to you! They can say 'I'm going to take all your money' and you'll just smile and say 'Sure!'" This may come as a shock but I don't want to come off as the weirdest girl immediately, although today I did comment to myself "Am I knitting a scarf or knitting my vagina shut?" <br><br>

				I've also been really into Goodreads. The best way I've described it to people is: LinkedIn meets Yelp with the exclusivity of Bitcoin. Basically no one I know uses it unlike Yelp and LinkedIn, really just the Bitcoin part. And no one ever really understood Bitcoins just like no one <em>really</em> understands Goodreads. Except Goodreads is pretty self explanatory. <br><br>

				So here we are in the pre study abroad phase. This summer was total and utter shit but I'm working on keeping my expectations low for the coming semester. Sure, I want it to be the absolute best time of my life and to find a Hungarian lover or just a lover at all and make many new close and amazing friends while learning tons of computer science, but let's be realistic... I might only learn a bit of computer science. I hope that I travel all over and if I travel alone, I hope that I don't get murdered or mugged. <br> <br>

				I'm excited to live in an apartment and to take a bunch of cool classes. I'm excited to choose my classes. Will the probability class work out? <em>Probably</em> not! I'm excited to travel Europe and meet new people and have new experiences. I'm excited to hopefully take the time away from Wes that I need right now. <br>
