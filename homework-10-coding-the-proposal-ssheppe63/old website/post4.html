			<b><p style="font-size:20px">day 1 -- I pretend to look at a watch</p></b>

			<p style="font-size:12px">8-15-16 10:34 PM</p>

			
			I woke up at 7 am and sadly couldn't go back to sleep, but 10 hours didn't seem too bad to cure jet lag. I did discover The Office isn't available in Budapest on Netflix, so I promptly bought season 1 on iTunes. I think this will be good for me to have to deal with what will one day be my reality in the US. After lying in bed for a nice 2-3 hours to start my day off, Carolyn and I attempted to buy groceries. Strong emphasis on attempt because we did not fully succeed. Definitely 3/4 succeeded but turns out when you buy produce at the grocery store (Spar) you're supposed to weigh it and get a price sticker on it. Our cashier just kind of looked at the produce and said something to us we couldn't understand and put it away. Also you have to bring your own bags but Becky had told me, luckily. We bought as many of the basics as we could figure out, but potentially bought bread flour and the eggs aren't refrigerated at the stores which is strange? <br><br>

			Upon returning to our house Carolyn &amp; I found **drumroll please** MORE PILLOWS! In fact, we all have <em>three</em> big ol' pillows now on our beds. Could not be happier about it. I then fell promptly asleep with my new cozy pillows. When I woke up Morgan and Farida had arrived! Morgan's from Dallas, but we don't seem to know any of the same people and she hasn't been to Torchy's. I took a shower once the girls all left to get their phones and, guess what mom &amp; grandma? The shower pressure is really good, way better than school, so no, I don't need to cut my hair! (And I bet I can still get a job) <br><br>

			I met the girls at the mall and then Keith. On my way their I was feeling good about my tram-taking ability but after running to get the tram that was already there I paused in front of the open door and then quickly walked away, because it was super crowded and I was nervous about punching my ticket. Since the whole car was looking at me, I pretended to look at my watch but I had taken it off to shower so that was rough. I met with Farida, Morgan, Carolyn, Montana and Keith for dinner and we went... somewhere. I had fried cauliflower, mushrooms and broccoli (trees). We went grocery shopping again after dinner and I tried to buy apples, scanned and stickered, but apparently I put the wrong name or brand, failed attempt #2.
