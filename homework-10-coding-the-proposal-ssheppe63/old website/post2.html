				I'm somewhere between hours five and six beginning my trip to Budapest. So far I've watched two mediocre movies (Mother's Day &#38; Boss). Strongly disappointed but very in love with Jason Sudeikis (ps help I just accidentally signed into the chat on the airplane screen) also for some reason the automatic option for watching with English is English with Chinese subtitles -- to be fair the woman in my row is using it. Not sure if she speaks Chinese (she's Hungarian) or if she doesn't know how to turn it off. <br> <br>

				Not sure how to put in words how freaked out I am about this trip. Honestly I'm scared about weird stuff like getting my <i>incredibly</i> overweight duffel bag into my apartment.. what if there's no elevator? Or losing all of my rent money or making a complete fool of myself by being one of the, if not the, least experienced computer scientist. All of the above are freaking me out. <br><br>

				Hugh Grant in <i>Notting Hill</i> is really something beautiful. One of my apartment mates(?) flat mates(?) room mates(?) is also coming today, Carolyn. I'm really excited to just meet new people and be in a new place. But freaking out because, well, what if it just goes wrong oh great the plane is getting bumpy ugh. But yeah, there's a lot to go wrong and I know I need to have low expectations and just hope that it just is *fine*. It doesn't need to be <b>amazing</b> I just want to enjoy myself for an extended period of time. <br><br>

				On my plane to Budapest. Found one of Crosby's hairs in my hair - great! Amsterdam airport was easier than expected and the kid behind me boarding the plane is doing BSM. Haven't slept in 24 hours ... I feel weird this is happening because since high school I've thought about my semester abroad and I never even considered Budapest. I'm not sure I specifically considered anything but Budapest wasn't on my radar. It's overwhelming and strange because I'm starting to actually reach big milestones in my life, and they're happening quickly. College, study abroad, leaving camp, Sophie getting braces, Ben going to college. All this stuff is happening and I feel like I don't even realize until the moment has passed. <br><br>
