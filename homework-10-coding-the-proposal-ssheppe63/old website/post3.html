				So I totally lucked out because not only did no one take the middle seat on my long plane ride to Amsterdam, but the woman, Maria, in the aisle seat was traveling to Budapest as well, and from there! She guided me through the Amsterdam airport and in getting my luggage in Budapest. <br><br>


				The first person I met off the plane was G&aacute;bor. We spent 40 minutes together waiting for Becky and Chris. What I learned about G&aacute;bor: he just graduated from high school, doesn't study computer science, has no clue what to do with his life or where to go to college, wants to travel or find a cool job this year, likes reading and writing in his diary (not sure if he was making fun of me with that one). Me being me, I had an unnecessary amount of luggage that I couldn't carry so as we were walking out of the airport I had a cart thing and when I took it down the curb it leaned right and everything fell off! After recovering from utter embarrassment in front of people I had just met 20 minutes ago we got in a "scary black van" and went to meet our angels at our apartments. <br> <br>

				I met with Dorka who showed me around the city, talked to me about Budapest and made me feel as comfortable as possible. Then I proceeded to stay awake so I could sleep at night. I really almost crashed but had to go meet Greg at the Westend Mall at 5 to get our phones. On my first tram ride, I completely struggled to find the place to click my ticket having to push past people and kind of smile apologetically because I have no clue how to say excuse me. And then I almost didn't make it off the tram at my stop because the city is RIDICULOUSLY crowded because of Sziget. Becky &amp; I talked with this great guy in order to figure out our phone planes... I'm back to the good ol' T9 text! Afterwards, Cal, Killian, Becky and I went to get dinner at some random place near the big synagogue/the language school. <br><br>

				I came home to find Carolyn at the apartment! I think it'll work out because she likes to bake cookies. I fell asleep before 9 pm.
